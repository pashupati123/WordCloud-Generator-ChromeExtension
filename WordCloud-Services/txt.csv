71,"March is third month of year and brings with it the warm(er), sunny days. This month bring the color of festivity which is commonly known as Holi in Northern part of India, however people celebrate this across India. Since we are talking about March month how come one should forget to talk about International Women’s Day which has been celebrated across the globe on 8th March. Since we are talking about Women’s day I would like to appreciate all my women colleagues and bosses with whom I have worked in the past and currently they all are exceptional and brings different perception to any discussion and supportive to me so far."

73,"Coming to March 2020 it’s has jolted entire world with COVID-19 and halted everyone’s daily life from a road side fruit seller to brick and motor retailer. At the same time, it gave us opportunity to think and operate differently. Every industry has started thinking how to ensure that business and work is moving and make the teams/individuals productive as lockdown has been imposed nationwide."
74,
75,We (coaches) has biggest challenge how to operate remotely and brain stormed and come up with different approach to run DOJO challenges remotely. And below are some of the ideas which we came up as a team
76,
77,"*Collaboration Channels: JIRA, Slack, Skype, Zoom"
78,
79,"*Daily Goals: Granular Task (Git commits, Jira task)"
80,
81,*Training/Assignment based
82,
83,*Team’s responsibility to bring up to speed the fellow TM’s on concepts missed
84,
85,*Live coding sessions should be rotational
86,
87,*Technical glitches – inspect and adapt

91,"I am extensively involved in DOJO challenge with Stores Control Team and it has lot of challenges involved from individual /team level coaching, we had to change our approach while coaching this team. "
92,
93,"Engaged with GDP team for portfolio coaching and this month i had conducted session for 3 GDP team Inferences & Insights, Guest Engagement and Interactions team. It was diffrent experience all together this time as we had to conduct these sessions virtually which needs lot of effort to ensure that all the audience  are engaged and actively participating. We (coaches) did brainstorming and ran couple of sessions and tried to simulate the session and figure our different ways. "

130,"""As teams started approaching DOJO, it gave valuable insights on how to start analysing a real world problem, what are the basic things that we should start with for getting ourselves indulged to design a roadmap of the things that are needed for both myself and the teams that have approached. With Anitha.R driving the first immersive challenge with the Stores Control Team, I have got an opportunity to understand some of the topics related to API development. Due to the pandemic COVID-19, everything has been shifted to remote sessions and I was not able to cope up with the things initially that have been going on due to network issues. Although the challenge isn't completed yet, looking forward to learn more and catch up how we can enable coaching remotely also."
131,
132,"I have also carried out the first DOJO Express session in this quarter - 'Hola Vela'. It was supposed to be held on 18th of March which was then later shifted to a remote session on 23rd of March. Due to networks issues this was shifted to 30th of March. However, the session very well received by more than 200 team members (the numbers were greater than the number of participants that we had on 23rd of March) and also ended up the session with an interactive Q&A session. As part of the preparation of the content for the session I've got a basic understanding of the different features of the Vela and how to use it."
